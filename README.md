What is kubernetes ?
    Kuberntes is a container orchestrator tool which was an internal product from google till 2014 and Google made it openSource in 2014

    Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers into logical units called "pods" for easier orchestration and resource management.
Kubernetes runs across clusters of machines, making applications highly available and resilient.

> How can I learn Kubernetes ?

    1) You can set up your own kuberntes cluster on your own nodes either on cloud or on-prem 
    2) You can use the managed service on AWS: EKS ( Elastic Kubernetes Service ) 
    3) Minikube ( This is a sandbox kubernetes environment) : Let's learn all the basics on this and then we can start going to EKS. 

> Kubectl vs kubelet

    kubectl: k8's client used to connect to kubernetes cluster which is installed on the computer/server from where we are connecting 
    kubelet: This is a local leader on the node which is going to report the node and worker status to the k8 master

> Can kube-api server talk to any other components ?

    In Kubernetes, the kube-apiserver is the central communication hubâ€”it is the only component authorized to interact with all other components within the cluster.

    For example, the scheduler does not communicate directly with etcd, nor does etcd communicate directly with the controller manager. All interactions flow through the kube-apiserver, ensuring a consistent and secure communication model.

> How to install kubectl ?
       $ curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
       $ curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
       $ sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
        ``` 
        chmod +x kubectl
        mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
        mv ./kubectl ~/.local/bin/kubectl # and then append (or prepend) ~/.local/bin to $PATH
        ```
       $ kubectl version --client [ To verify installation ]

> What are minikube hardware requirement ?

```
    2 CPUs or more
    2GB of free memory
    30GB of free disk space
```

> How to install minikube ? Ensure you provision the lab instance with 30gb and t3.medium

    0) Ensure you fix the space issue
        $ growpart /dev/nvme0n1 4
        $ sudo lvextend -l +50%FREE /dev/mapper/RootVG-homeVol ;
        $ sudo lvextend -l +1000%FREE /dev/mapper/RootVG-varVol ;
        $ sudo xfs_growfs  /var ; sudo xfs_growfs  /home
    1) Install Docker: 
        $ sudo dnf install docker -y 
    2) Download Minikube
        $ curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/latest/download/minikube-linux-amd64
    3) Install minikube
        $ sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube && rm minikube-linux-amd64
    4) Start minikubne
        $ minikube start

> How to test the connectivity to the cluster or get the cluster info

    $ kubectl cluster-info
        Kubernetes control plane is running at https://192.168.49.2:8443
        CoreDNS is running at https://192.168.49.2:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

        To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
        
> How can we connect to kubernetes cluster
    1) kubectl  ( cli way of accessing the cluster : This is the most preferred & highly used )
    2) non-cli  ( K9s ) 
    3) K9s UI   ( Octane )

> Going forward, we don't say we will run the containers on kubernetes. Instead, we say we run the pods. 

> What is a POD in kubernetes ?
Pod is the smalled computable component on kubernetes cluster and on this we container will run and this is referred as a "Wrapper To The Containers"

> A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context.

> One of the biggerst operational challenge of Shared Storage & Network was solved by Kubernetes via Pods and it's a big achievement

> Kubernetes offers lots of varieties of respources and it's all about API's,
    You want x-resourc,e you need use some api 
    You want x-resourc,e you need use some api [ No need to byheart any of these, it's all available in the documentaiton ]

> kubernetes command syntax:

    $ kubectl verb  resource  [ syntax ]
    $ kubectl get pods
    $ kubectl cluster-info 
    $ kubectl api-versions  

> Kuberntes offers lot of variety of resources to compliment the pods functionality and these resources can be created by the follwing ways:

    1) Manual approach ( By suppling the values : This is not recommended as we cannot version control it )
        $ kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx

    2) Declarative approach ( Define all the needed properties as per the documentation and version control it: This is the recommended pattern ) 

    K8 resources can be created in declarative pattern by using YAML 

        $ kubectl create -f fileName.yaml
        $ kubectl apply -f fileName.yaml
